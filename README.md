# WeLoveMovies Frontend Application

## Live Links
You can find the github for the backend [here](https://github.com/clarisse-fong/movies-backend) and the deployed frontend [here](https://movie-frontend-84do.onrender.com/). 

## About
I created the backend for a movies website called WeLoveMovies for a capstone project at my Thinkful / Chegg Skills Engineering program. 

The project required the following technologies: 
* PostgreSQL as the database
* Knex to build queries for PostgreSQL
* Express to write routes for API methods.

From the assignment
> You've been hired as a backend developer at a new startup called WeLoveMovies. As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

### Fixing Frontend Errors
Although my job was primarily backend, I noticed a couple frontend errors where the movie image wasn't properly being displayed. I plan to fix these errors.
